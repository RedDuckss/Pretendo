                On a more serious note: this will be extremely difficult to do.
                Nintendo implements CORS in the eShop.
                This makes it near impossible for us to load external resources for a custom eShop.
                To make a complete eShop replacement we would have to get around this CORS.
            </h3>
            <h3>CORS notes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The eShop makes a `POST` request to "https://ninja.wup.shop.nintendo.net/ninja/ws/my/session/!open". This then creates a pre-flight `OPTIONS` request returning the CORS options</li>
                <li>We can spoof the `Origin` header in the above request to change the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header with partial success</li>
                <li>Setting the `Origin` header to `*` will load into the eShop, but immediately crash with a "111-9001" error</li>
                <li>This crash is most likely due to the `Referer` header, which is always set to ": https://geisha-wup.cdn.nintendo.net/geisha/?version=1.0.0&scene=detail&dst_title_id=0005001010040100&src_title_id=0005001010040100"</li>
                <li>Changing the `Referer` header will crash the eShop before it even loads</li>
                <li>We can partially get around the CORS issue by spoofing requests and proxying those. For example, loading the image "https://cdn3.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-22-at-5.25.03-PM.png" does not work because of CORS (`cdn3.dualshockers.com` is not allowed). We can make a request to "https://geisha-wup.cdn.nintendo.net/imgtest/1.png" and then proxy that request to the proper image (`geisha-wup.cdn.nintendo` IS allowed)</li>
                <li>Doing the above is SLOW. If we use that method we MUST optmize by making the images smaller in size and using jpg</li>
                <li>The game list seems to served over UDP/PRUDP. I am unsure if this is affected by CORS</li>
            </ul>
